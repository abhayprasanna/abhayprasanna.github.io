# Instructions for Installation

Copy [this code](http://abhayprasanna.github.io/dark-age-dracula.css) and paste it into a css code block in your [[roam/css]].
Feel free to customize the fonts, colors, etc. and add any other code you like below this as needed.

This works by linking to an outside .css file, actually located [here](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) to handle all the styling, as it keeps the roam/css page much cleaner/faster.

If you do in fact want to manipulate the source code, just [navigate to the source .css file](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) manually, copy it, and paste it all into your roam/css page.
