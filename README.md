# Instructions for Installation

Copy [this code](http://abhayprasanna.github.io/dark-age-dracula.css) and paste it into a css code block in your [[roam/css]].
This theme also follows the light/dark theme of your OS.
Feel free to customize the fonts, colors, etc. and add any other code you like below this as needed.

This works by linking to an outside .css file, actually located [here](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) to handle all the styling, as it keeps the roam/css page much cleaner/faster.

If you do in fact want to manipulate the source code, just [navigate to the source .css file](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) manually, copy it, and paste it all into your roam/css page.

Here are some [optional CSS](https://github.com/abhayprasanna/abhayprasanna.github.io/blob/master/optional.css) additions and tweaks you can play with.
If you'd like to include *rainbow indents* please add [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/abhayprasanna/abhayprasanna.github.io/blob/master/rainbow-indent.css).
