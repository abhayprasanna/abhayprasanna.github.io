If you want to make any changes, copy [this code](http://abhayprasanna.github.io/dark-age-dracula.css) and paste it into a css code block in your [[roam/css]].

This works by linking to an outside .css file, actually located [here](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) to handle all the styling, as it keeps the roam/css page much cleaner/faster.

If you do in fact want to manipulate the source code, just [navigate to the source .css file](https://abhayprasanna.github.io/better-dark-age.css) manually, copy it, and paste it all into your roam/css page.

Here are some [optional CSS](https://github.com/abhayprasanna/abhayprasanna.github.io/blob/master/optional.css) additions and tweaks you can play with.
